## Application of Server Rules

All members agree to be bound by the Minecraft EULA and OGCraft’s Rules while using any of our Services (Minecraft server, Discord server, etc.). Violations may result in temporary or permanent access restriction. You will have a fair opportunity to have concerns reviewed.

## Access to OGCraft and Our Services

- **Free access** to all OGCraft Minecraft servers and associated services.  
- **Supporter ranks** are voluntary thank-you gifts for donations—**not** goods or services.  
  - Issued voluntarily; non-refundable; non-chargebackable.  
  - Time-limited: 30 days per donation.  
  - Current ranks (as of 29 March 2025): Allay, Golem, Wither. See the store for updates.  
  - OGCraft may deny, modify, suspend, or revoke supporter privileges at any time, without warning or compensation.

## Legitimacy of Payments

- Payments must be authorized by the account holder/cardholder.  
- Unauthorized payments may result in immediate removal of privileges.

## Payment Values

- All values are in **USD**.  
- International transaction fees charged by your bank/payment provider are your responsibility.

- If no rank after 24 hours, contact a staff member.

## Refundability & Cancellation

- All donations are **final and non-refundable**.

1. Donating directly to OGCraft  
2. Receiving a gifted rank
