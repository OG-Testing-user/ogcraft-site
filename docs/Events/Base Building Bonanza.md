# Base Building Bonanza

With the first month done and Fly and other goodies unlocked, it's time we got you to show off your bases!

**Show us your builds through April 15th** — and who knows, you might get some great goodies.

I'll be judging if you want to drop your cords. There's a prize for **1st, 2nd, and 3rd place**:

- 🥇 **1st Place**: 10 Tools & Gear keys + 20k server money  
- 🥈 **2nd Place**: 5 Tools & Gear keys + 16k server money  
- 🥉 **3rd Place**: 2 Tools & Gear keys + 12k server money  

> In the event the base is shared between multiple players, the prize will be split as evenly as possible, with the claim owner taking the majority if there's an uneven split.

**Towns do count as bases!** But every player in the town will be counted.
