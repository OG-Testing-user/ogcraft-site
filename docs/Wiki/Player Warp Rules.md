## Generic Pwarp Rules

1. **Safety First**  
   - No hostile mobs allowed.  
   - Must be 100% claimed.  
   - Players cannot die on warp unless clear warning signs are posted (e.g. witches throwing potions).

2. **Creation Fee**  
   - Each Pwarp costs **$1,000** to create.

3. **Category Required**  
   - You must assign one of the three categories when setting a Pwarp; uncategorized Pwarps will be removed.
   - Set a category using `/pw category set (Shop Name) (Shops/Farms/Towns)`
   - Example: `/pw category set ExampleShop Shops`

---

## Shop Pwarp Rules

- **Minimum Shops:** At least **10** distinct shops per Pwarp.  
- **Stock Rule:** If more than **50%** of your shops are out of stock, a 7-day removal timer begins.

---

## Grinder Pwarp Rules

1. **Safe Warp Location**  
   - Warp must deposit players in a safe zone; they must then move into the grinder area (no immediate deaths).

2. **Spawner Requirement**  
   - Provide access to a total of **10** spawners (can span multiple grinder setups) so the public can grind mobs at 10 spawners’ worth.

---

## Town Pwarp Rules

- **Town Hall / Welcome Area**  
  - Must display the town rules prominently.

- **Claim Structure**  
  - The “mayor” claims the entire town in one big claim.  
  - Sub-claims are used for individual residents’ builds.

- **Residents List**  
  - All residents must be listed in the welcome area.

- **Minimum Population**  
  - At least **3** residents plus the **mayor**.
