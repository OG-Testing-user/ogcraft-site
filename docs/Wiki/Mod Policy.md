# Client-Side Mod Policy

We want players to enjoy the game their way, as long as it's fair. This mod policy outlines what's allowed and what isn't when it comes to client-side modifications.

---
:::warning
You're responsible for the mods you use. If you're unsure whether a mod is allowed, ask staff **before** using it. Using disallowed mods may lead to warnings, kicks, bans, or other penalties depending on severity.
:::


## ✅ General Rule

**If a mod does not give you an unfair advantage over other players, it is allowed.**

Our main concern is competitive fairness. Mods that automate gameplay, reveal hidden information, or alter mechanics to give you an edge are **not allowed**.

## ✅ Allowed Mods

These types of client-side mods are allowed because they improve the experience without giving a gameplay advantage:

- **Performance Mods**
  - Sodium, Lithium, OptiFine, etc.
- **Visual Mods**
  - Shaders, BetterF3, Dynamic Surroundings, or HUD customizers.
- **Minimaps (with restrictions)**
  - Journeymap, Xaero’s Minimap (as long as cave mode and entity radar are turned **off**).
- **Utility Mods**
  - Inventory Tweaks, Mouse Tweaks, Light Overlay (F7), Replay Mod.
- **Cosmetic Mods**
  - Capes, Armor/Hat swaps, or any purely visual feature.
- **Schematica or Litematica**
  - Only allowed for building guides — **printer mode is not allowed**.

## ❌ Disallowed Mods

These mods are prohibited because they provide a clear gameplay advantage:

- **Hacked Clients or Cheats**
  - Anything like Wurst, Aristois, or similar.
- **X-Ray Mods or Texture Packs**
  - Anything that lets you see ores, caves, or players through walls.
- **Auto-Clickers & Macros**
  - Using auto clickers or macros that bypass the /afk timer is not allowed. 
- **Entity Radar / Tracers**
  - Mods that show mobs or players outside normal render or line of sight.
- **Flight or Speed Hacks**
  - Any movement-modifying tools that exceed what’s allowed by the server.
