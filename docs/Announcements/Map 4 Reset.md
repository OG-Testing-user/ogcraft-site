title: Map 4 Reset
---

Well well well, it’s that time again… **OGCraft** is resetting its map!

However, we have a little twist: instead of a huge spawn, we listened to your feedback and built one of the **smallest spawns** in OGCraft history—packed with hidden treasures to discover!

##  When is the reset happening?

- **Map 4 Closing:** April 6, 2024 • 10 AM MST  
- **Map 5 Opening:** April 7, 2024 • 10 AM MST  

##  Some new additions

- **Monthly crates** are back, plus revamped vote crates & vote party crates  
- **New item-ranking system** (see below)  
- **Temporary lockdown:** `/fly`, `/speed`, and `/shop` disabled during Week 1 for fair play  
- **World size:** 50,000 blocks (up from 15,000)

##  Small General Changes

- Website now functions as a **wiki**—admins can appoint editors to keep content up to date  
- Placed spawners have a **20% break chance** even with Silk Touch

##  Things that are being reset

- Inventories  
- Enderchests  
- Claimblocks  
- Money balance  
- Kits  
- Playervaults  
- mcMMO progress  
- **All worlds**

##  Things that will **not** be reset

- Ranks  
- Playtime  

##  Item Ranking

With monthly crates returning, we’re introducing a new ranking system:

- **Normal** – standard items, no special rank  
- **Rare** – slightly above-vanilla enchantments  
- **Epic** – stronger enchantments, rarer to obtain  
- **Legendary** – most powerful items, hardest to get  
- **Novelty** – fun items (Fish Slap, Pokey Stick) with hidden crafting potential  
- **One of a Kind** – unique, server-only items (only one exists)

##  How can I bring items to the new map?

Only **trophy items** (birthday/event rewards) and **historical items** may be transferred:

1. Fill a **shulker box** with your trophy/historical items  
2. **Rename** the box to your exact Minecraft username  
3. **Hand it in** to a staff member (irreversible)

> Don’t have a shulker box? Use `/kit Shulker` to receive one free!  
> **Final turn-in:** April 5, 2024

## Exact schedule

- Server closes on **April 6th at 10 AM MST** for final prep  
- Reopens **April 7th at 10 AM MST**

## World download?

No public download—maps are too large. We’ll archive spawn builds for nostalgia.

##  What version will the server be?

- Target: **Minecraft 1.19.4** (plugins permitting)  
- Pending 1.20 release—will upgrade ASAP without another reset

##  Special thanks

To our Architects **Nixstyx**, **Jabai**, **ChunkyPumpkin2**, and staff **Elliott**, **Flash**, **Roman**, **Swanky**.
