title: Map 6 Reset
---


Can you believe it? Map 6 is already up and here we are heading into Map 7. This will be the first official map where OGCraft and Pioneer players start together at the same time and progress together under one roof!

Speaking of roofs, we’ve raised it this time ’round! I think this new spawn is the biggest spawn we’ve ever made—only rivaled by the Zelda Castle back in Map 2. Huge thanks to Nix and our newest Architect Silver_Seven for helping create, in my opinion, one of the best spawns we’ve ever had, along with Elliott and the rest of the build team!

##  When is the reset happening?

- **Map 6 Closing:** May 3, 2024 • 10 AM MST  
- **Map 7 Opening:** May 4, 2024 • 10 AM MST

##  Some new additions

- **Spawn Easter Egg** with a custom-built minigame—still playable after the EE is finished!  
- **Quest NPCs** in spawn, from the Prison Guard to the Horse Trainer. Dive into spawn’s lore and hidden treasures.  
- **Interactive chat** (from Pioneer)—show off your cool and special items!  
- **EpicSellWands** are back—purchase via `/shop` or find them in crates.  
- **Sit anywhere**—slabs, stairs, floors, even other players’ heads!  
- **New online map**: use `/map` in-game or visit https://map.ogcraft.org  
- **New voting rewards** (details below)

##  Small General Changes

- Behind-the-scenes staffing plugin updates  
- `/fly` moved from Diamond → Emerald to match rank progression  
- **Player referral** rewards added: new joiners who use `/ref <your_username>` earn shared rewards, scaling with referral count  
- Legacy permanent supporter kits changed to monthly kits (one per 30 days)

##  Voting reward structure

- **Daily Vote Crate**: earn a key by voting on all sites each day  
- **Weekly Vote Crate**: earn a key by voting each day for seven days (choose your reward!)  
- **Milestone rewards** at 100 total votes (10 days)—see `#server-voting` in Discord or our website  
- **Boss bar** displays most recent voter & votes remaining until Vote Party (thanks superminiminer & ShadowVoid!)  
- **More claimblocks** awarded per vote

##  Things that are being reset

- Inventories  
- Enderchests  
- Claimblocks  
- Money balance  
- Kits  
- Playervaults  
- All worlds  

## Things that will **not** be reset

- Ranks  
- Playtime  

## What version will the map be on?

We’re aiming for **1.20.5** (fallback to **1.20.4** if plugins aren’t ready). We’ll start with a smaller world border and expand to **1.21** later to accommodate new Trial Chambers.

## How can I bring items to the new map?

All items transfer except **spawners**. Use `/kit reset` to receive your reset kit (contains a shulker box + bundle).

### How to pack your reset kit

1. **Fill your bundle** with desired items (no spawners—they craft back into keys via `/warp recipes`).  
2. **Place the bundle** inside the shulker box.  
3. **Identify Trophy Items** (special-named/lored event items) and **Historical Items** (`One of a Kind` lore, dragon eggs, EE rewards).  
4. **Add Trophy & Historical Items** to your shulker box.  
5. **Hand in** your packed shulker box to a staff member (you cannot retrieve it afterward).

**Final day to turn in shulker boxes:** **May 2, 2024**  
>If you can’t hand it in person, keep it in your inventory and post your exact username in our Discord—staff will grab it remotely.

>Once the new map is live, moderators will distribute shulker boxes. **Any spawners found will be removed without warning.**

## Store Refunds

All store purchases after **May 1, 2024** will be granted on Map 7.
