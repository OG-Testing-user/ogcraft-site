title: Map 5 Reset
---


Is it that time already? Yes it is! **OGCraft** is resetting its map!

Like every reset, we have a brand-new map! We wanted to go outside the box a little bit and do something we’ve never done before…
##  When is the reset happening?

- **Map 5 Closing:** September 28, 2023 • 16:00 UTC  
- **Map 6 Opening:** September 30, 2023 • 16:00 UTC  

##  Some new additions

- **Spawn Easter Egg** is back! No hints, no clues—just good old problem solving (and possibly some dancing).  
- **Weekly Game Nights**—more on that below!  
- **Multiple datapacks** adding new structures (3 village types, deep dark dimension) and making hostile mobs harder the longer you play.  
- **Quests** overhauled: 700+ quests and a special rank for full completion.  
- **Server Sponsorship** section on the store—help us grow and get your name featured!

##  Small General Changes

- Donator ranks converted to **monthly** versions (curly brackets `{}` in name); existing permanent donors keep their kits & rank prefix `[ ]`.  
- Monthly rank time **accumulates**—buy 30 days today, another 30 days tomorrow = 60 days total.  
- **Spawn** is now in the main world—no separate spawn world.  
- Massive **/shop** overhaul—every item tweaked or rebalanced.

##  Things that are being reset

- Inventories  
- Enderchests  
- Claimblocks  
- Money balance  
- Kits  
- Playervaults  
- **All worlds**  

##  Things that will **not** be reset

- Ranks  
- Playtime  

## Weekly Game Nights

Map 6 introduces **Weekly Game Nights** with 4 events each month. Compete in multiple games to earn points and prizes!

- **Points** earn entries into the **Battle of Gamers**—top 3 players each month get extra prizes.  
- **Lucky draw** for all other point-earners (each point = one entry).  
- Event dates announced on the last day of the prior month.

##  How can I bring items to the new map?

Transfers limited to **Trophy Items** (event rewards) and **Historical Items** (Dragon Eggs, special-lore items).

1. **Fill** a shulker box with your Trophy & Historical Items.  
2. **Rename** the box to your exact Minecraft username.  
3. **Hand in** to a staff member—once submitted, it cannot be returned.  

> Don’t have a shulker box? Use `/kit Shulker` to receive one free!  
> **Final turn-in:** September 27, 2023  

Moderators will distribute boxes on Map 6 launch.
