title: Map 7 Reset
---

Well that’s it folks, our longest map is coming to an end. After a staggering 10 months, **Map 7** will be officially closing.

Last map we focused on everything you could see, this time around we have focused on all the behind-the-scenes things whilst bringing more and more new features to the server.

I say this every map, but that’s because I mean it every time: **this new map is going to be the best map we have ever produced.**

##  When is the reset happening?
