## üèÖ How do the ranks work? {#ranks}

There are two types of ranks on the server:

### ‚è±Ô∏è Playtime Ranks
These ranks are earned simply by playing on the server! As your (non-AFK) playtime increases, you‚Äôll automatically unlock new ranks with kits, permissions, and useful commands.

- Check your playtime with: `/ar time`  
- See your progress toward the next rank with: `/ar check`

### üí∏ Paid Ranks
These are monthly subscription ranks that come with extra perks like kits, cosmetic commands, and more.  
All proceeds from paid ranks go directly toward covering server operating costs, all of our staff members are volunteers.

üëâ View and purchase ranks through our [store](https://store.ogcraft.org)
