# FAQ's

## 🏅 How do the ranks work?

There are two types of ranks on the server:

### 💸 Paid Ranks
These are monthly subscription ranks that come with extra perks like kits, cosmetic commands, and more.  
All proceeds from paid ranks go directly toward covering server operating costs — all of our staff members are volunteers.

👉 View and purchase ranks through our [store](https://store.ogcraft.org)

### ⏱️ Playtime Ranks
These ranks are earned simply by playing on the server! As your (non-AFK) playtime increases, you’ll automatically unlock new ranks with kits, permissions, and useful commands.

- Check your playtime with: `/ar time`  
- See your progress toward the next rank with: `/ar check`

## 🏠 How do claims work?

To protect your builds, you can claim land using a **golden shovel**  
➡️ Get one with `/kit claim`

### 🔲 How to create a claim:
1. Use the golden shovel to right-click two opposite corners (minimum size: 10x10 or 100 blocks total)
2. The area between will be protected from other players
3. Use `/trust [username]` to allow others to build in your claim

### 📈 Earning more claim blocks:
- +100 claim blocks per hour of playtime
- +100 per [vote](/docs/Info/Voting)

## 🗺️ How long do maps last?

There’s no fixed schedule for map resets, but maps generally last **9 to 12 months**.  
If a map is especially active or popular, it may last longer.  
**You’ll always receive advance notice before any reset happens.**
