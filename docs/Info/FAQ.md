## 🏅 How do the ranks work? {#ranks}

There are two types of ranks on the server:

### 💸 Paid Ranks
These are monthly subscription ranks that come with extra perks like kits, cosmetic commands, and more.  
All proceeds from paid ranks go directly toward covering server operating costs — all of our staff members are volunteers.

👉 View and purchase ranks through our [store](https://store.ogcraft.org)

### ⏱️ Playtime Ranks
These ranks are earned simply by playing on the server! As your (non-AFK) playtime increases, you’ll automatically unlock new ranks with kits, permissions, and useful commands.

- Check your playtime with: `/ar time`  
- See your progress toward the next rank with: `/ar check`

## 🗺️ How long do maps last? {#map-duration}

There’s no fixed schedule for map resets, but maps generally last **9 to 12 months**.  
If a map is especially active or popular, it may last longer.  
**You’ll always receive advance notice before any reset happens.**
