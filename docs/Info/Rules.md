1. **No Griefing Builds**  
   Griefing is the act of deliberately destroying, modifying, or defacing another playerâ€™s creations or the world around you. Even unclaimed or seemingly abandoned builds are off-limits.


2. **No Spam or Excessive Caps**  
   Avoid sending the same message repeatedly, using long strings of characters, or typing in all caps. Keep chat clear and readable for everyone.


3. **No Scamming**  
   Do not trick, deceive, or manipulate other players into giving you items, ranks, or in-game currency under false pretenses. Always be honest in trades.


4. **No Item Duplication (Exploits)**  
   Any duplication exploit that duplicates items, blocks, or entities is prohibited.  
   **Exceptions:** certain server-approved mechanics [allowed dupes here](/docs/Wiki/Duping%20Policy). If you are in doubt whether a dupe is permitted, please ask a staff member. Ignorance is not an excuse.


5. **No Inappropriate Builds**  
   Builds containing profanity, hate symbols, explicit content (e.g. genitals), or other inappropriate imagery/text are forbidden. Keep the world family-friendly.


6. **No Soliciting Staff**  
   Donâ€™t beg staff members for ranks, items, money, or special treatmentâ€”unless you are engaging in a fair, in-game trade. Staff promotions are earned, not gifted.


7. **No X-Ray or Unfair Advantage Mods**  
   The use of X-ray mods, abuse of texture packs, exploits, or any third-party tools that give you an unfair advantage is strictly banned.  
   [**See our client mod policy:**](/docs/Wiki/Mod%20Policy)


8. **Respect All Players**  
   Treat everyoneâ€”new players, veterans, staff alikeâ€”with courtesy. Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks will not be tolerated.


9. **No Impersonation**  
   Do not pretend to be another player, staff member, or public figure. Usernames, skins, and chat behavior must not mislead others.


10. **English in Public Chat**  
    Please keep the main chat in English so moderators can monitor effectively. Our staff do not know every language, so itâ€™s impossible to moderate non-English chat. Feel free to use other languages in private messages.


11. **No AFK Bypass**  
    Do not use macros or other tricks to avoid the AFK timer.


12. **Staff Decisions Are Final**  
    All rulings by staffâ€”warnings, kicks, bansâ€”are final. Disputes must go through the appeal process in Discord.


13. **No Political Discussion**  
    Avoid debates or discussions about politics in public chat.


14. **No Advertising Other Servers**  
    You may mention major, well-known servers (e.g. Mineplex, Hypixel) in context, but promoting small or private servers (or sharing IPs) is forbidden, even in direct messages.


15. **Shop & Town Warp Rules**  
    All `/pwarp` claims must follow the rules outlined [here](/docs/Wiki/Player%20Warp%20Rules).


16. **Use Common Sense**  
    If it feels like it might break a rule, donâ€™t do it. When in doubt, ask a staff member before acting. Ignorance does not exempt you from the rules.

17. **No Dating/Relationships**  
    Since we have younger players (some as young as 9) who arenâ€™t yet aware of online safety risks, weâ€™re making it a rule that these kinds of conversations or interactions arenâ€™t allowed. This helps keep the server safe and fun for everyone.

:::note Disclaimer
Discord requires all users to be 13+ to have a Discord account, regardless of parental approval. Because of this, we require all Discord users to be 13 or older. This is a Discord rule and not an OGCraft rule, so there will be no debate on this. If you are found to be under 13 years old, you will be removed from the Discord server.
:::

1. **Be Respectful & Courteous**  
   Treat every member as you wish to be treated. Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination will result in swift removal from our community.


2. **No NSFW or Obscene Content**  
   Any text, image, link, or GIF thatâ€™s pornographic, excessively violent, or otherwise inappropriate is banned.


3. **No Spam or Excessive Caps**  
   Avoid flooding channels with repeated messages, emojis, or all-caps text. Keep conversation clear and on-topic.


4. **Report Unsafe Behavior**  
   If you feel threatened, harassed, or uncomfortable, DM any staff member or use the [Create a Ticket](https://discord.com/channels/724002762320380015/736902416250961981) channel on Discord. Weâ€™re here to help.


5. **No Advertising Other Servers**  
   Mentioning major networks (e.g. Hypixel) is okay, but promotion of other servers or private invites is prohibited.


6. **Label All Links Clearly**  
   When posting a URL, make sure itâ€™s clear what it is. Fake Nitro/verification links or misleading URLs will be deleted and you will be removed from the OGCraft Discord.


7. **No Unnecessary Pings**  
   Avoid pinging staff or other users without reason.


8. **Use Appropriate Channels**  
   Keep conversations in their intended channels. For support, ask in the [Questions channel](https://discord.com/channels/724002762320380015/745185687774560317) or use [Create a Ticket](https://discord.com/channels/724002762320380015/736902416250961981).


9. **Do Not DM Staff for Promotions**  
   Staff will reach out if you qualify for any promotional or partnership opportunitiesâ€”no cold DMs.


10. **No Abuse of Support Tickets**  
    Abusing the ticket system will result in ticket restrictions or removal, and may incur further penalties.


11. **No Handouts**  
    Do not ask for free ranks, keys, items, or money from staff or other players.
